A single image face swap costs 1 credit, meaning each free user can swap faces in up to 10 images per day. A cloth swap costs 2 credits, and a video face swap costs 3 credits.
Paid users have two options: a monthly subscription or an annual subscription.

The prices for the monthly subscription are as follows:

The prices for the annual subscription are as follows:

The main differences between paid and free users are the number of bonus credits given and other additional functions.

Now, let's consider whether it's necessary for the average user to spend money on so many credits.

**Photo Face swap（Score:8/10）**

Faceswapper supports 3 styles of face swapping: anime style, realistic photos, and a hybrid style.

You only need to upload 2 photos but remember to upload the target photo first (the face photo) and then the original photo (the photo you want to swap face).

Here are the face-swapped effects compared to [DeepSwap](https://www.deepswap.ai/):

Faceswapper's face swap effects are decent, but it seems to only support about 70% similarity.

Deepswap can provide a higher similarity of around 90%, however, the facial features do not look as natural as those produced by Faceswappe.

**Batch Photo Face Swap（Score: 5/10）**

Faceswapper also supports multi-face swapping. 

However, each time it can only swap faces for the same person, and does not support swapping different faces for multiple people simultaneously. 

For instance, I can swap the next character's face with the same person's face, but I cannot simultaneously swap their faces with three different people.

What annoys me the most is that after you swap a face once, you cannot swap another person's face on the processed image.

You must first download the image with the swapped face, and then upload it again to swap another person's face.

**AI cloth swapper（Score: 6/10）**

The platform supports changing the clothing of characters in uploaded images through text prompts.

I successfully swapped the model's dress for a bikini. However, there are still some flaws in the details, such as the straps.

But this mode does not support uploading images of clothes for cloth swapping

**Video Face swap (Score: 0/10)**

Faceswapper has recently introduced a video face swap feature. You start by uploading a facial photo, followed by the target video. 

It seems that for free users, face swapping is only supported for videos up to 15 seconds, but paid users can experience it for longer durations. 

Typically, there is also a wait time of 5 to 10 minutes for the swap to take effect.

However, after trying it out and waiting for over 10 minutes, I found that the face swap was completely unsuccessful. There was no change in the character.

We can only look forward to future updates to its effectiveness.

| • The image face-swapping results have a high degree of similarity and look very natural, without heavy AI traces. | • However, the image processing for obstructions is not good.                                 |
| • Supports an AI clothing swap model, compatible with most types of clothing.              | • Multi-person face-swapping operations are very inconvenient; it's not possible to swap multiple people's faces simultaneously. |

## Conclusion

The cheapest value for Faceswapper is $6.9 per month, which after payment, gives you close to 500 credits. 

This means you can perform 500 image face swaps, 250 AI clothing swaps, and over 160 video face swaps. However, the AI clothing swap and video face swap technologies are still very immature, and these two features are not very useful.

Therefore, if you have a large number of images to process, Faceswapper is quite suitable. But if you want to use the Video face swap feature, then Faceswapper is not appropriate at all.
